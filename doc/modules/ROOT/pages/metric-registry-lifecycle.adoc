[[metric-registry-lifecycle]]
= Metric registry lifecycle

Lifecycle of metric registries is controlled by the `io.smallrye.metrics.MetricRegistries` application-scoped bean.
If it is necessary to drop and recreate a metric registry during runtime, it is possible to call
`MetricRegistries.drop(MetricRegistry.Type)` to drop one particular registry, or `MetricRegistries.dropAll()`.
After a metric registry is dropped, a new empty registry will be automatically initialized  when a reference to the
particular registry type is being requested.

The `io.smallrye.metrics.MetricRegistries` class is also meant to be public API, so applications are allowed
to use its static method `get` to obtain references
to metric registries without having to inject them using CDI.
